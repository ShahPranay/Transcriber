very clearly one of the things that i want to do is
i want to enhance the student experience and we're facing the problems of assets are that when i was a faculty member of the one with sleeping like that as and i think we can make it exciting mean thing to do is we need to have many more opportunities for students with quality education that's the only not doesn't like a student
new phases of a measles
at first i would like to ask you about your entire journey you a mechanical engineering graduate from id bomb valhalla pst from the same city or this makes me want to ask what does your memory of preparing for the id a examination did you also like a lot of sort of law
lock yourself in a room to study already
it was you know we're talking us a time long back gay the it's nineteen eighty two is when they give the g at that time the g was a subjective d
so we had difficult questions but it was you know it's also my it's not just the answer it's not like an m c q
i know we we didn't we didn't study during the eleventh and twelfth and
so it wasn't i don't think it was as difficult to get in as it is now
the after that i have i did my paycheck i did the for your be doing eighty two to eighty six than i worked for a year
and then i came back and ended my views d a dirty bomb be there work for three years and then joined the faculty so i have i have essentially apart from four years of my life i've always been on an eighty campus so home so that that's been my sorrow were doing these on the time you up your for the exams did an older than a lot of changes in the
exam patterns in the we didn't prepare for those exams recently there's also news of jay and need being most together and james's of thing for times on the get of the every month now for their children get students get more attempts so what are your views on this like how is it impacted the ah
you know what happens i think viejo
the id system we're facing the problems of our success the in know in the when i did my be jake there was not that much hype about the eighties and the alumni subsequently after the
internet boom in the the kind of whoa the silicon valley successes essentially a t became a much more referred destination so to deal if we see in ip then the in order to get in your have to been the top three thousand or so and that see out of now
nine legs you can do the person did it's a very small percentage so ye
nowhere in the world do have this kind of selectivity and this is a problem so easy easy really is highly competitive and it's more of a mean there are lots of people who get rejected were very good soon so this is this is a problem
and whatever exam you do i don't know and the main thing to do is we need to have many more opportunities for students with quality education that's new in the long term solution
oh so coming over to ward off you are you were in the feel of resort and beating what already long duration how does it feel to have i missed it of new these now and if you ever feel disconnected
with the current responsibilities you have
so you know i
i really enjoy
enjoyed eating i'm seeing enjoyed teaching because i'm not teaching for dame no older women and didn't some occasional glasses with really enjoy teaching i really enjoy interacting with students and go
a the
administration is somewhat different but also the thing is that you do want to see you been in the system i've been a student i've been a faculty there are many things you feel that way is it like this can you improve this so better things that you feel that you can do when you were as and
administrator you have the opportunity to do that that are also constraints of course sand or but i think going down now i would definitely want to have more
discussions and direct interaction with students and hopefully also beat at least part of courses
it's a choice that i have taken and who here so that's how i in it
what did you enjoy it more being a student or a professor that id
i think a student
ah i'll tell you
the
actually
as a student you feel in our
you feel empowered
you also
you don't see any constraints you feel you can do anything and from a new as a student i used to feel that you know the
the faculty lectures are so boring and why should it be like this he should actually make it excite being what's going on than i thought that when i was a faculty member no no one would sleep in my class and i would do things we could make it exciting but when you go to the other side you find that it's people sleep in your class
and if you try all kinds of stuff which he doesn't happen so it's a different perspectives said i think the student
student fees is a very nice and why should really enjoy that frees them into the student fees do you have any best austin experience
oh there are many has still experiences so we either a student i was involved i was also
active student in the in not find and the oh we had this thing movie called we had from each department a set off the it was like a final layer thing we called we had a meeting where we wanted to give our experiences of what is what the institute we should do to make the educational exp
syrians better and we knew we had to people from each department and recall several i could remember that we had a whole host of things we thought we'd
yeah so we really believe that we could
change everything of in the a hostile things that i into her still rivalries i'm sure it's that year old so you have been
you have these competitions and then the things it is so sometimes it goes out of hand you said of a he can say little so there are many many such studies and i used to try to even that i used to train reconcile things and used to be yeah so we're but it's it
a very exciting
is it coming over to our daily itself out what are your favorite sport on campus
there's a lot of greenery lots of the cocks and why life on and say it's it's it's it's really beautiful beautiful campus the lecture hall complexity on the lake and be few growing it's impressive you go around day i remember when they when the first still bad just game enough to the him second semester
in this set of see i wanted to see whether you know we are able to weather the best too much crowding and believe that could be protocols that being maintained and it was very exciting to see all these it's coming into class and the excitement of given an opportunity which course already ordered the stated will add
i've always wanted to do economics so that's that's one thing philosophy but what does the was great to received an id a thing could c d used to collect cds what
what would it mean him
cnc see minus a legacy see minus one of because they think it was an engineering drawing
a little extra ridiculously part of
when i i i was mainly and billion are debating wheezing on the cultural things there used to organize second thing that so i mean i
i'm not good at sports produce generally if we're lucky we are you the football games the people tennis isn't cricket but not not not good i mean you it but i did yeah i did air
i've used to chase and i used to be part of many of the
i was in the trees sick secretary of the hostelling do you have an id director or tab group
yeah daily than i that ago except group
it said i didn't know what group along with the ministry
oh so then as a ministry official so it's a restricted group and outfits
also do you have or development on your life
i don't think so
i don't know why i'm them of experience that have any slang of the guy
no actually not as i read about some of the or whatever can be given
you must have one foot talking process when you joined this article and said you'd especially your vision and the impact the want to create so what are the middle teens and you're targeting here at i didn't
see where they came in here
the first thing weeks ago
you know i believe the we have to do things where we have to work as a team citing want to start off by saying that you know these other things i want to do i want to change this i want to do this i wondered if they want to understand the system
work with people and figure out but very clearly one of the things that i want to do is i want to enhance the student experience i want to make sure that we actually support individual student aspirations are this is easier said than done because basically what we need to do is we need to have a mentorship
and whether it is a faculty mentorship but we tried to see
in our kids when they come in we're not very sure what we want to do and as an institution we're are providing an overall experience oh so this is one of the things that can bump into while also want to see that me give students a complete expediency including some opportunities to him
moss and work in teams and work on your life problem so you get a sense of what is there so the first priority is to see that we make our curriculum more relevant we see that we announced the student excuses the second thing is when we talk in terms of a faculty it's
not a lot of faculty time goes in things retail beyond teaching and research and in dealing with all kinds of administrative think so how can we enable then see that record it and can concentrate on that that's the that's a sick and the third thing is to see that everything that we do we focus a little bit on more on suicide
so these are the three broad things are service had been floater in recent months regarding the course that a could have and previously we it was mandatory to complete one eighty credits for the course completion but not have introduced relate one fifty of not so would you like to shed about the new policies and curriculum load of you so actually what we're doing it
his you're doing this is after about i think eight to ten years were doing a clue sixty degrees curriculum review and essentially we've got a committee flaws which is looking at an overall principle of what the curriculum should be looking at other curriculum in other i guess looking at curriculum across the world and then seeing
what should be the features core elective flexibility credits everything and that report is about to come out it was supposed to come out some time in this month in august
nice that report comes out it will be sent out for discussion amongst all stakeholders and then we will go to the process of looking at each individual curriculum in each of this we will not just we will dig
student inputs faculty and boots
elaine industry books and hopefully with twenty twenty three we will have a
you could he could so basically we look ahead the principal and the policy they would he agree with it to has remained under high stress levels ah what are some changes or like to bring about to are probably the of on the core structure are trying to make a relatively stress
i think
support systems is one thing was stress free
support systems
changing attitudes
i'm not sure where the the stress comes from curriculum or created solve so you have to have been will have to
figure out what is happening in this were curriculum when we talk of curriculum i think one of the important things is you will see the actually the nature of science and technology is changing very rapidly in many fields
and though we need to have skill sets we need to have i do we need to have flexibility
anger
you know that is there are two things one is competition the second is cooperation and in order to be successful i believe that students also need to learn how to work in teams we're to individualistic a competitive some part of it we have to do because we there is a certain amount of vinegar and certain amount
the preparation that needs to be done the challenges how can we do this without creating stress i don't know dances but i know that we would want to create a responsive support mechanism
and i will have been talking to the dean students and been academics as well as to faculty colleagues will get
groups of faculty main goes along with ah
senior students to create some systems like this
